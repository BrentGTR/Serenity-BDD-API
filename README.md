## Optimizations (project refactors)

Refactors are sometimes needed for easily identifying elements in GUI projects. This is the list of the ones done:
 
- Add <env.MAVEN_REPO_URL> https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/</env.MAVEN_REPO_URL>
- Remove all instances of Gradle to conform with project requirements
- Change seren-cuke6 dep to seren-cuke dep to resolve dep issues
- Refactored org.codehaus.groovy:3.0.12 to org.apache.groovy:4.0.1 to resolve dependency issues
- Added .gitlab-ci.yml for use in pipeline
- URL for multi-project pipeline setup: https://tinyurl.com/brentsawesomelink
